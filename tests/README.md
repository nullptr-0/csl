# CSL Test Suite

This directory contains the regression test suite for the CSL language.

## Structure

- `valid/`: Contains `.csl` files that are syntactically and semantically correct. The test runner expects these to parse and validate with **no errors and no warnings**.
- `invalid/`: Contains `.csl` files that have known errors (syntax or semantic). The test runner expects these to fail (produce **at least one error or warning**).

## Running Tests

Tests are run using the `csl-test` binary generated by the core C++ build.

From the repository root:

```bash
# Assuming csl-test is in your build directory
./build/csl-test --test tests
```

## Adding New Tests

1.  Identify if the case should be valid or invalid.
2.  Create a minimal `.csl` file in the appropriate subdirectory.
3.  Name it descriptively (e.g., `valid_wildcard_nested.csl` or `invalid_missing_semicolon.csl`).
4.  Run the test runner to verify it behaves as expected.
